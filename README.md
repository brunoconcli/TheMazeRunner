# Hello everyone!
As for a quite challenging task, me and my classmates were a couple weeks ago propesed to make this project in java:
> A .txt file would be passed, containing a maze build with the characters '#' (representing walls), 'E' (being the way in), 'S' (being the way out) and ' ' (spaces, in which the program would be able to "step in" in fact)
> Based on the maze read by a class named ```Reader``` and a set of simple __rules__, the program was meant to figure out a the exit of the maze, in very short time
>> ## Rules
>> The rules were very simple, the 'main Character' would only be able to step through the space chars, placing a * symble where it was passing, as a sort of trail;
>> It would keep following it's way, based on a ```queue``` containing the current move possibilities for each step, until it was surrounded by three walls, being its only way to step back until it was back to the trail;

After spending some great time invested into making it good, it finally worked! And as for that I would like to appreciate some things:
> Thanks @miguel-l-b, for showing me his own interpretation in the very begining of the project so I could get my own kickstart (not the he wouldn't come back to give me a hand many other times);
> Appreciate my teacher Maligno for the great code sample and complex but smart project, and for having learned so much through the entire process;

Hope anyone who intends running the code to check the results likes it!
Pleasing coding y'all.
